# Coding Challenge #54 - tar
[Challenge](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-54-tar)
This repo contains my implementation of the tar coding challenge. The implementation is far from perfect or complete, however I decided to allocate my time to different projects. Future effort would focus on improving the program options parser and introducing file compression (gzip).
